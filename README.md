# marks-management-system
The system takes input from the user, such as the student's department, roll number, and marks obtained in various subjects.
Based on the input, the app calculates the total marks obtained by the student and the percentage of marks.
Built using an interactive menu driven C++ program, our project is founded on the essential principles of OOP.
